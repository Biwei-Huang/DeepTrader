## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Pytorch == 1.3.1.
- Pandas >= 0.25.1
- Numpy >= 1.18.1
- TensorFlow >= 1.14.0 (For you can easyly use TensorBoard)
- ...

## Data Preparing

According to the data usage policies of WRDS and WIND, we have no right to provide you with a copy of the data except for industry_classification.npy file :). If you have access to the WRDS or WIND database, please obtain and process the corresponding data yourself based on our paper. 

The following files are needed:

|                    File_name                     |                  shape                   |                  description                   |
| :----------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
|                 stocks_data.npy                  | [num_stocks, num_days, num_ASU_features] |       the inputs for asset scoring unit        |
|                 market_data.npy                  |       [num_days, num_MSU_features]       |     the inputs for marketing scoring unit      |
|                     ror.npy                      |          [num_stocks, num_days]          | rate of return file for calculating the return |
| relation_file (e.g. industry_classification.npy) |         [num_stocks, num_stocks]         |     the relation matrix used in GCN layer      |



These files should be placed in the ./data/INDEX_NAME folder, e.g. ./data/DJIA/stocks_data.npy

## Training

As an example, after putting data source file to the data folder, you can simply run:

`python run.py -c hyper.json`

Some of the available arguments are:

| Argument          | Description                                                | Default                     | Type  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----- |
| `--config`        | Deafult configuration file                                 | hyper.json                  | str   |
| `--window_len`    | Input window size                                          | 13 (weeks)                  | int   |
| `--market`        | Stock market                                               | DJIA                        | str   |
| `--G`             | The number of stocks participating in long/short each time | 4 (for DJIA)                | int   |
| `--batch_size`    | Batch size number                                          | 37                          | Int   |
| `--lr`            | learning rate                                              | 1e-6                        | float |
| `--gamma`         | Coefficient for adjusting lr between ASU and MSU           | 0.05                        | float |
| `--no_spatial`    | Whether to use spatial attention and GCN layer in ASU      | True                        | bool  |
| `--no_msu`        | Whether to use market scoring unit                         | True                        | bool  |
| `--relation_file` | File name for relation matrix used in GCN layer            | Industry_classification.npy | str   |
| `--addaptiveadj`  | Whether to use addaptive matrix in GCN (Eq. 2)             | True                        | Bool  |
